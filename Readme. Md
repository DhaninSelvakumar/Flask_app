Flask Hiring TestWhy this test?We build applications for the web, so understanding how web applications work, is apre-requisite for any new engineer. Flask is one of the simplest and well written Pythonbased web application frameworks and can easily be learned in a few hours.If you have never worked on web applications before, this test will also help youevaluate whether this is something you are skilled at or can easily learn doing.Inventory Management Web ApplicationThe goal is to create a web application using Flask framework to manage inventory of alist of products in respective warehouses. Imaging this application will be used in ashop or a warehouse that needs to keep track of various products and various locationsThe application should cover the following functionalities:Database Tables:● Product (product_id)● Location (location_id)● ProductMovement (movement_id, timestamp, from_location, to_location,product_id, qty)Note:1. Primary keys can be text / varchar2. Any one, or both of from_location  and to_location  can be filled. If you want tomove things into  a location, from_location  will be blank, if you want to movethings out, then to_location  will be blank.Views:● Add/Edit/View Product● Add/Edit/View Location● Add/Edit/View ProductMovementReport:● Balance quantity in each locationUse Cases:● Create 3/4 Products● Create 3/4 Locations● Make ProductMovements● Move Product A to Location X● Move Product B to Location X● Move Product A from Location X to Location Y● (make 20 such movements)● Get product balance in each Location in a grid view, with 3 columns: Product,Warehouse, Qty

5. View the Report
After creating all movements, go to the Report page to see the inventory balance across all locations.

Features Implemented
✅ Database Tables
Product: Stores product information with product_id as primary key
Location: Stores warehouse/location information with location_id as primary key
ProductMovement: Tracks all inventory movements with support for:
Moving items INTO a location (from_location is NULL)
Moving items OUT of a location (to_location is NULL)
Transferring between locations (both fields populated)
✅ CRUD Operations
Products: Add, Edit, View all products
Locations: Add, Edit, View all locations
Movements: Add, Edit, View all movements with timestamp tracking
✅ Inventory Report
Grid view showing Product, Warehouse, and Quantity
Automatically calculates balance by:
Adding quantities for movements TO a location
Subtracting quantities for movements FROM a location
Only displays locations with non-zero inventory
Sorted alphabetically by product and location
✅ User Interface
Clean, modern, responsive design
Navigation menu for easy access to all sections
Flash messages for user feedback
Form validation
Mobile-friendly layout
Key Technical Details
Movement Logic
from_location = NULL, to_location = SET: Stock coming IN
from_location = SET, to_location = NULL: Stock going OUT
from_location = SET, to_location = SET: Transfer between locations
At least one location must be specified
Report Calculation
The report calculates inventory by processing all movements:

Initialize all product-location combinations to 0
For each movement TO a location: add quantity
For each movement FROM a location: subtract quantity
Display only non-zero balances
Database
Uses SQLite (inventory.db) for simplicity
Database is automatically created on first run
All tables use VARCHAR/TEXT for primary keys as specified
